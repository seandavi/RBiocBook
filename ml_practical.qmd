The mlr3 R package is a modern, object-oriented machine learning framework in R
that builds on the success of its predecessor, the mlr package. It provides a
flexible and extensible platform for handling common machine learning tasks
such as data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model
evaluation @fig-mlr3-ecosystem. The package is designed to simplify the process of creating and
deploying complex machine learning pipelines.

### Key features of mlr3

* Task abstraction 
  : mlr3 encapsulates different types of learning problems
  like classification, regression, and survival analysis into "Task" objects,
  making it easier to handle various learning scenarios.
* Modular design
  : The package follows a modular design, allowing users to quickly swap out
  different components such as learners (algorithms), measures (performance
  metrics), and resampling strategies.
* Extensibility
  : Users can extend the functionality of mlr3 by adding custom components like
  learners, measures, and preprocessing steps via the R6 object-oriented
  system.
* Preprocessing
  : mlr3 provides a flexible way to preprocess data using "PipeOps" (pipeline
  operations), allowing users to create reusable preprocessing pipelines.
* Tuning and model selection
  : mlr3 supports hyperparameter tuning and model selection using various
  search strategies like grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization.
* Parallelization
  : The package allows for parallelization of model training and evaluation,
  making it suitable for large-scale machine learning tasks.
* Benchmarking
  : mlr3 facilitates benchmarking of multiple algorithms on multiple tasks,
  simplifying the process of comparing and selecting the best models.
