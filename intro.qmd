## Introduction

In this chapter, we will discuss the basics of R and RStudio\index{RStudio}, two essential
tools in genomics data analysis. We will cover the advantages of using R and
RStudio, how to set up RStudio, and the different panels of the RStudio
interface.

## What is R?

[R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language) is a programming
language and software environment designed for statistical computing and
graphics. It is widely used by statisticians, data scientists, and researchers
for data analysis and visualization. R is an open-source language, which means
it is free to use, modify, and distribute. Over the years, R has become
particularly popular in the fields of genomics and bioinformatics, owing to its
extensive libraries and powerful data manipulation capabilities.

The R language is a dialect of the S language, which was developed in the 1970s
at Bell Laboratories. The first version of R was written by Robert Gentleman
and Ross Ihaka and released in 1995 (see [this slide
deck](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/downloads/Massey.pdf) for Ross
Ihaka's take on R's history). Since then, R has been continuously developed by
the R Core Team, a group of statisticians and computer scientists. The R Core
Team releases a new version of R every year.

## Why use R?

There are several reasons why R is a popular choice for data analysis,
particularly in genomics and bioinformatics. These include:

1. **Open-source**: R is free to use and has a large community of developers
   who contribute to its growth and development. [What is "open-source"?](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source)
1. **Extensive libraries**: There are thousands of R packages available for a
   wide range of tasks, including specialized packages for genomics and
   bioinformatics. These libraries have been extensively tested and ara
   available for free.
1. **Data manipulation**: R has powerful data manipulation capabilities, making
   it easy (or at least possible) to clean, process, and analyze large
   datasets.
1. **Graphics and visualization**: R has excellent tools for creating
   high-quality graphics and visualizations that can be customized to meet the
   specific needs of your analysis. In most cases, graphics produced by R are
   publication-quality. 
1. **Reproducible research**: R enables you to create reproducible research by
   recording your analysis in a script, which can be easily shared and executed
   by others. In addition, R does not have a meaningful graphical user
   interface (GUI), which renders analysis in R much more reproducible than
   tools that rely on GUI interactions.
1. **Cross-platform**: R runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux (as well as more
   obscure systems).
1. **Interoperability with other languages**: R can interfact with FORTRAN, C,
   and many other languages.
1. **Scalability**: R is useful for small and large projects.

I can develop code for analysis on my Mac laptop. I can
then install the *same* code on our 20k core cluster and run it in
parallel on 100 samples, monitor the process, and then update a database (for example)
with R when complete.

## Why not use R?

- R cannot do everything.
- R is not always the “best” tool for the job.
- R will *not* hold your hand. Often, it will *slap* your hand instead.
- The documentation can be opaque (but there is documentation).
- R can drive you crazy (on a good day) or age you prematurely (on a
    bad one).
- Finding the right package to do the job you want to do can be
    challenging; worse, some contributed packages are unreliable.]{}
- R does not have a meaningfully useful graphical user interface (GUI).

## R License and the Open Source Ideal

R is free (yes, totally free!) and distributed under GNU license. In particular, this license allows one to:

- Download the source code
- Modify the source code to your heart’s content
- Distribute the modified source code and even charge
    money for it, but you must distribute the modified source code
    under the original GNU license]{}

This license means that R will always be
available, will always be open source, and can grow organically without
constraint.

## RStudio

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It provides a
graphical user interface (GUI) for R, making it easier to write and execute R
code. RStudio also provides several other useful features, including a
built-in console, syntax-highlighting editor, and tools for plotting, history,
debugging, workspace management, and workspace viewing. RStudio is available in
both free and commercial editions; the commercial edition provides some additional
features, including support for multiple sessions and enhanced debugging

### Getting started with RStudio
 
To get started with RStudio, you first need to install both R and RStudio on
your computer. Follow these steps:

1. Download and install R from the [official R website](https://cran.r-project.org/).
2. Download and install RStudio from the [official RStudio website](https://posit.co/downloads/).
3. Launch RStudio. You should see the RStudio interface with four panels.

### The RStudio Interface
 
RStudio's interface consists of four panels (see @fig-rstudio-interface):

* Source
  : This panel is where you write and edit your R scripts. You can create new
  scripts, open existing ones, and run your code from this panel.
* Console
  : This panel displays the R console, where you can enter and execute R
  commands directly. The console also shows the output of your code, error
  messages, and other information.
* Environment
  : This panel displays your current workspace, including all variables, data
  objects, and functions that you have created or loaded in your R session.
* Plots, Packages, Help, and Viewer
  : These panels display plots, installed packages, help files, and web
  content, respectively.

## Customizing the RStudio Interface
 
You can customize the layout of RStudio to suit your preferences. To do so, go
to **Tools > Global Options > Appearance**. Here, you can change the theme, font
size, and panel layout.

In summary, R and RStudio are powerful tools for genomics data analysis. By
understanding the advantages of using R and RStudio and familiarizing yourself
with the RStudio interface, you can efficiently analyze and visualize your
data. In the following chapters, we will delve deeper into the functionality of
R, Bioconductor, and various statistical methods to help you gain a
comprehensive understanding of genomics data analysis.
