## Adult learners

Adult Learning Theory, also known as Andragogy, is the concept and practice of
designing, developing, and delivering instructional experiences for adult
learners. It is based on the belief that adults learn differently than
children, and thus, require distinct approaches to engage, motivate, and retain
information @author_lifelong_2016. The term was first introduced by Malcolm
Knowles, an American educator who is known for his work in adult education
@knowles_adult_2005.

One of the fundamental principles of Adult Learning Theory is that adults are
self-directed learners. This means that we prefer to take control of our
own learning process and set personal goals for themselves. We are motivated
by our desire to solve problems or gain knowledge to improve our lives (see @fig-why-learn). As
a result, educational content for adults should be relevant and applicable to
real-life situations. Furthermore, adult learners should be given opportunities
to actively engage in the learning process by making choices, setting goals,
and evaluating their progress.

Another key aspect of Adult Learning Theory is the role of experience. We
bring a wealth of experience to the learning process, which serves as a
resource for new learning. We often have well-established beliefs, values,
and mental models that can influence our willingness to accept new ideas and
concepts. Therefore, it is essential to acknowledge and respect our shared and unique past
experiences and create an environment where we all feel comfortable sharing
our perspectives.

To effectively learn as a group of adult learners, it is crucial to establish a collaborative
learning environment that promotes open communication and fosters trust among
participants. We all appreciate and strive for a respectful and supportive atmosphere
where we can express our opinions without fear of judgment. Instructors
should help facilitate discussions, encourage peer-to-peer interactions, and
incorporate group activities and collaboration to capitalize on the collective
knowledge of participants.

Additionally, adult learners often have multiple responsibilities outside of
the learning environment, such as work and family commitments. As a result,
we require flexible learning opportunities that accommodate busy
schedules. Offering a variety of instructional formats, such as online modules,
self-paced learning, or evening classes, can help ensure that adult learners
have access to education despite any time constraints.

Adult learners benefit from a learner-centered approach that focuses on
the individual needs, preferences, and interests of each participant can
greatly enhance the overall learning experience. In addition, we tend to 
be more intrinsically motivated to learn when we have a sense of autonomy and
can practice and experiment (see @fig-stuck-ds) with new concepts in a safe environment.

Understanding Adult Learning Theory and its 
principles can significantly enhance the effectiveness
of teaching and learning as adults. By respecting our autonomy, acknowledging our
experiences, creating a supportive learning environment, offering flexible
learning opportunities, and utilizing diverse teaching methods, we can
better cater to the unique needs and preferences of adult learners.

In practice, that means that we will will not be prescriptive in our approach
to teaching data science. We will not tell you what to do, but rather we will
provide you with a variety of options and you can choose what works best for
you. We will also provide you with a variety of resources and you can choose where
to focus your time. Given that we cannot possibly cover everything, we will
provide you with a framework for learning and you can fill in the gaps as you
see fit. A key component of our success as adult learners is to gain the confidence
to ask questions and problem-solve on our own.
