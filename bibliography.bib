The expression profiles observed for genes with known metabolic functions pointed to features of the metabolic reprogramming that occur during the diauxic shift, and the expression patterns of many previously uncharacterized genes provided clues to their possible functions. The same DNA microarrays were also used to identify genes whose expression was affected by deletion of the transcriptional co-repressor TUP1 or overexpression of the transcriptional activator YAP1. These results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of this approach to genomewide exploration of gene expression patterns.},

	abstract = {With high-dimensional data, variable-by-variable statistical testing is often used to select variables whose behavior differs across conditions. Such an approach requires adjustment for multiple testing, which can result in low statistical power. A two-stage approach that first filters variables by a criterion independent of the test statistic, and then only tests variables which pass the filter, can provide higher power. We show that use of some filter/test statistics pairs presented in the literature may, however, lead to loss of type I error control. We describe other pairs which avoid this problem. In an application to microarray data, we found that gene-by-gene filtering by overall variance followed by a t-test increased the number of discoveries by 50\%. We also show that this particular statistic pair induces a lower bound on fold-change among the set of discoveries. Independent filtering—using filter/test pairs that are independent under the null hypothesis but correlated under the alternative—is a general approach that can substantially increase the efficiency of experiments.},

	abstract = {The field of machine learning includes the development and application of computer algorithms that improve with experience.Machine learning methods can be divided into supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised methods. Supervised methods are trained on examples with labels (for example, 'gene' or 'not gene') and are then used to predict these labels on other examples, whereas unsupervised methods find patterns in data sets without the use of labels. Semi-supervised methods combine these two approaches, leveraging patterns in unlabelled data to improve power in the prediction of labels.Different machine learning methods may be required for an application, depending on whether one is interested in interpreting the output model or is simply concerned with predictive power. Generative models, which posit a probabilistic distribution over input data, are generally best for interpretability, whereas discriminative models, which seek only to model labels, are generally best for predictive power.Prior information can be added to a model in order to train the model more effectively when it is provided with limited data, to limit the complexity of the model or to incorporate data that are not used by the model directly. Prior information can be incorporated explicitly in a probabilistic model or implicitly through the choice of features or similarity measures.The choice of an appropriate performance measure depends strongly on the application task. Machine learning methods are most effective when they optimize an appropriate performance measure.Network estimation methods are appropriate when the data contain complex dependencies among examples. These methods work best when they take into account the confounding effects of indirect relationships.},

              Although Southern blots are the traditional method of identifying

              in different tissues, stages of development, diseases, and
              species. Mapping DNase I hypersensitive (HS) sites within nuclear
              chromatin is a powerful and well-established method of
              identifying many different types of regulatory elements, but in
              the past it has been limited to analysis of single loci. We have
              recently described a protocol to generate a genome-wide library
              of DNase HS sites. Here, we report high-throughput analysis,
              using massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS), of 230,000
              tags from a DNase library generated from quiescent human CD4+ T
              cells. Of the tags that uniquely map to the genome, we identified
              14,190 clusters of sequences that group within close proximity to
              each other. By using a real-time PCR strategy, we determined that
              the majority of these clusters represent valid DNase HS sites.
              Approximately 80\% of these DNase HS sites uniquely map within
              one or more annotated regions of the genome believed to contain
              regulatory elements, including regions 2 kb upstream of genes,
              CpG islands, and highly conserved sequences. Most DNase HS sites
              identified in CD4+ T cells are also HS in CD8+ T cells, B cells,
              hepatocytes, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and
              HeLa cells. However, approximately 10\% of the DNase HS sites are
              lymphocyte specific, indicating that this procedure can identify
              gene regulatory elements that control cell type specificity. This
              strategy, which can be applied to any cell line or tissue, will
              enable a better understanding of how chromatin structure dictates

	abstract = {Bioconductor is a widely used R-based platform for genomics, but its host of complex genomic data structures places a cognitive burden on the user. For most tasks, the GRanges object would suffice, but there are gaps in the API that prevent its general use. By recognizing that the GRanges class follows “tidy” data principles, we create a grammar of genomic data transformation, defining verbs for performing actions on and between genomic interval data and providing a way of performing common data analysis tasks through a coherent interface to existing Bioconductor infrastructure. We implement this grammar as a Bioconductor/R package called plyranges.},
