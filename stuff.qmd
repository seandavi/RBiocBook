# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

## What is AI?

- Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.
- AI systems can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

## What is Machine Learning?

- Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.
- ML algorithms improve their performance on a specific task over time without being explicitly programmed to do so.
